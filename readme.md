# Python Chat
### this project is socket based chat server.

##### To run this project run the  > server.py file first. 

##### Then run two instances of the > client.py file 

these two clients will be the ones communitcating, the server just handles the events and logs the chat.

run the file and input a Nickname to use as a username.
the server will check if the nick is already in use and return a unable to connect code.

The server should dynamicly retrive the local IP address, then start the server to accept connections and handle the clients as indivual threads.
